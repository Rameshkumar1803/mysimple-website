            Why Do We Need Engineering? Engineering is a crucial part of
             our society because it provides solutions to the problems we
              face in our daily lives. Engineers use their knowledge, 
              skills, and creativity to design, build, and maintain 
              systems, structures, and technologies that improve our 
              quality of life.</h1>

          engineering student in terms of time spent learning, 
          sleeping, socializing, etc.?.

        Engineers get to use and hone their problem-solving
         and critical thinking skills, while also using their 
         imagination. Many engineers' jobs overlap with their hobbies
          as well, making their work something enjoyable. Another key factor
